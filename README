LLMHistorSearch Privacy Policy (Browser Extension)

LLMHistorySearch processes and stores your chat content locally in your
browser to provide search across ChatGPT, Claude, and
Gemini. LLMHistorySearch does not collect, transmit, or sell your chat
content to our servers or third parties. You can pause capture or
delete all locally stored data at any time via the extension
settings. If you enable an optional sync/backup feature in the future,
any data would be encrypted client-side before leaving your device.

  IMPORTANT NOTES

  1. LLMHistorySearch searches only conversations performed using
  Chrome on a single computer, not across computers

  extension has been installed. To search prior conversations, you
  must re-visit them after installing LLMHistorySearch

  external servers
