ConversAI Privacy Policy (Browser Extension)

ConversAI processes and stores your chat content locally in your
browser to provide search across ChatGPT, Claude, and
Gemini. ConversAI does not collect, transmit, or sell your chat
content to our servers or third parties. You can pause capture or
delete all locally stored data at any time via the extension
settings. If you enable an optional sync/backup feature in the future,
any data would be encrypted client-side before leaving your device.

  HOW TO USE:
  1. Install this extension
  2. Visit and use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok (conversations are automatically captured in the background)
  3. Go to conversai.us and search your conversations by keyword

  ---
  If you use multiple LLM chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude, it may be tedious to find a specific past conversation: you'd have to search each chatbot until you find it. conversai searches your conversations
   on four major LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and Grok) from a single, simple Web page conversai.us. Just type in the keywords (like Google search) and you'll get links to the conversations, across all the
   LLMs, that include those keywords.

  IMPORTANT NOTES:
  - conversai searches only conversations performed using Chrome on a single computer, not across computers
  - conversai searches only conversations performed after the extension has been installed. To search prior conversations, you must re-visit them after installing conversai
  - Target audience: people accessing multiple LLMs from a single computer via Chrome
  - All data is stored locally in your browser - nothing is sent to external servers
