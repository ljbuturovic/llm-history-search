llm-history-search Privacy Policy (Browser Extension)

llm-history-search processes and stores your chat content locally in your
browser to provide search across ChatGPT, Claude, and
Gemini. llm-history-search does not collect, transmit, or sell your chat
content to our servers or third parties. You can pause capture or
delete all locally stored data at any time via the extension
settings. If you enable an optional sync/backup feature in the future,
any data would be encrypted client-side before leaving your device.

  IMPORTANT NOTES

  1. llm-history-search searches only conversations performed using

  must re-visit them after installing llm-history-search

  external servers
