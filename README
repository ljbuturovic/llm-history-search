llm-history-search Privacy Policy (Browser Extension)

llm-history-search processes and stores your chat content locally in your
browser to provide search across ChatGPT, Claude, and
Gemini. llm-history-search does not collect, transmit, or sell your chat
content to our servers or third parties. You can pause capture or
delete all locally stored data at any time via the extension
settings. If you enable an optional sync/backup feature in the future,
any data would be encrypted client-side before leaving your device.

  HOW TO USE

  1. Install this extension

  2. Visit conversai.us and use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok
  (conversations are automatically captured in the background)
  
  3. Point Chrome to conversai.us and search your conversations by
  keyword

  IMPORTANT NOTES

  1. llm-history-search searches only conversations performed using
  Chrome on a single computer, not across computers

  2. llm-history-search searches only conversations performed after the
  extension has been installed. To search prior conversations, you
  must re-visit them after installing llm-history-search
  
  3. Target audience: people accessing multiple LLMs from a single
  computer via Chrome

  4. All data is stored locally on your computer; nothing is sent to
  external servers


manifest.json status

As of November 29, 2025, there are two pending submissions: Chrome and
Mozilla Web Stores.

The Chrome submission uses manifest a397543; the Mozilla submission
uses c294bcd. At some point, maybe resubmit the latest to Chrome. Not
urgent because the changes only affect Firefox.
