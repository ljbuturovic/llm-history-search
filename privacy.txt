conversai processes and stores your chat content locally in your
browser to provide search across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and
Grok. conversai does not collect, transmit, or sell your chat content
to our servers or third parties. You can pause capture or delete all
locally stored data at any time via the extension settings. If you
enable an optional sync/backup feature in the future, any data would
be encrypted client-side before leaving your device.
